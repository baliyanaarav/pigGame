Pig Game using HTML , CSS AND JAVASCRIPT
The Pig Game is a simple dice game where two players take turns rolling a single die. Each player's objective is to accumulate a higher score than their opponent. On a turn, a player rolls the die, and the number rolled is added to their current score. If a player rolls a 1, their current score resets to zero, and it becomes the next player's turn. However, if they choose to "hold," their current score is added to their total score, and it becomes the opponent's turn. The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds a predefined winning score.
